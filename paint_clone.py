  Not too long ago (last week maybe?) someone posted a request
for an example of a paint program using Tkinter. Try as I might
I can't seem to find it in the archive, so i'll just post mine
here and hope that the person who requested it sees this!

  All this does is put up a canvas and draw a smooth black line
whenever you have the mouse button down, but hopefully it will
be enough to start with.. It would be easy enough to add some
options like other shapes or colors...

                                                yours,
                                                dave mitchell
